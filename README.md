<h1 align="center">ASCEND.IO - A REACT CLICKER GAME</h1>

## :book: About

Ascend.io is a simple and addictive game where the goal is to earn points by clicking a button. However, there's a catch: with each click, there's also a chance to lose everything! You can purchase items that increase the points per click but also raise the risk of losing points, adding a strategic element to the game.

This game was built using Vite + React, leveraging the React Context API to manage the game state. This approach reduces the need for multiple useState hooks scattered throughout the application and eliminates the need for external state management libraries like Zustand, making the codebase simpler and more maintainable.

The game's design is intentionally simple, as the primary focus was to explore development using these modern web technologies. There are still several features I plan to implement, such as balancing the game and its items, visual feedback for points (showing how much is increasing or decreasing), new items with unique mechanics, among other improvements.
